      "\n",
      "Cause I have read that the interest on a mortgage may be two thirds or a half of the principal (the amount you have borrowed). So naturally I am confused. ['You pay 2% per year. \\n\\nRealistically, it’s 1/12 * rate on the balance each month, since the loan balance goes down each month', 'On a $100,000 mortgage at 2% for 30 years your payment / month would be $369.62, which means you would end up paying $33,063.20 in interest.', 'You pay 1/12 of 2% every month. \\n\\nIn a $100K mortgage, you’d pay $369 per month. The first month, you’d be charged 1/12 of 2%, or $166.67.So the first month, the balance of your mortgage drops by $100,000-(369-166.67). The second month, your mortgage is now $99,797. That month you get again get charged 1/12 of 2%, but now against that slightly lower number. So this month, when you pay $369, you get charged thirty cents less interest,  $166.33. So you pay off thirty cents more of the house than you did with payment #1. And so on and so on.', '[https://www.bankrate.com/calculators/mortgages/amortization-calculator.aspx](https://www.bankrate.com/calculators/mortgages/amortization-calculator.aspx)\\n\\nStudy loan amortization. Basically, every month, part of your payment goes to interest and part to paying off the loan. As your loan shrinks, the interest portion of the payment shrinks and the principal portion goes up.\\n\\nEssentially, every month you pay (2% / 12) \\\\* balance in interest. Since next month, your balance is smaller, the interest is smaller. Towards the end of the loan, you pay hardly any interest in the payment.', 'Mortgages are simple interest loans, and a lot of the explanations I\\'ve seen scanning these responses make them a bit too simple, so I\\'ll explain in a bit more detail here:\\n\\nWhen you make a payment your payment first goes towards any accumulated interest that has accrued since your last payment was made. To determine that interest due the principal balance is multiplied first by the rate, then divided by the number of days in the year, then multiplied by the number of days since your last payment.\\n\\nAs an example, a loan of 100k at 2% interest would mean that a year\\'s interest would be $2,000. Divide that by the 365 days if the year and you\\'ll have $5.4794520547 of interest accumulating per day, this is what\\'s called the \"Per Diem\". \\n\\nIf you get your loan and 30 days later make your first payment, then you multiply that per diem by that 30 days, accumulating ~$163.40 in interest in that period. If you then make a payment of say $300, then the first $163.40 of that payment applies to that accumulated interest, the remaining. $136.60 goes towards your principal balance.\\n\\nThis means that the per diem is then recalculated once that principal has been adjusted by your payment. So the new principal balance is $99,863.40, which will be multiplied by 2% for a total of $1,997.27, divided by 365, which comes to $5.4719671232 which is a fraction of a penny lower than the last per diem.\\n\\nWith time and payments the principal balance gets lower and lower which in turn reduces the per diem, meaning future payments have an even greater impact on the principal balance. \\n\\nNow, this may seem really complex for something called \"simple interest\" but what it does is reward frequent payments and principal only payments, and severely punishes late payments, because consider the problems of missing a payment: if you waited 60 days to make a payment, then in the above scenario you\\'ve accumulated double the interest in that time, so when you finally make that payment $0 goes towards the principal balance, and in fact a bit of that interest due is still left owed, which slows your payoff meaning you lose more money to interest.\\n\\nAlternatively, if you make an extra $100 principal only payment each month, then you\\'ve reduced your per diem by a greater amount than you normally would, meaning you are getting your house/car for less finance cost than you contracted for.\\n\\n*The figures above are subject to fat fingers as I\\'m hopping back and forth between calculator apps and don\\'t have time to be sure those are 100% accurate, but the principal of the explanation is sound*', 'Is this a homework question?', '> I have to repay $102k\\n\\nIt depends on the terms of the loan.  The longer the terms the more you’ll pay on interest by the time it’s paid off.  At 2% you’ll pay around $1,800 on interest on a 12 mo term loan, compared to around $5,000 on interest on a 5 yr loan term, these are two examples on how the length of the loan affects how much you pay on interest.', 'You would pay 2% against the principle amount owed each month. So the interest owed does go down each month as it is recalculated against the new principle amount. The amount that goes towards principle will increase each month, but your payment would stay the same over the term unless you have an adj interest rate.', 'I have a 50k at 9.3%. If I run it the whole 23 years I’ll pay over 150k', 'Get a loan amortization calculator.  Based on your loan terms, it will show you a schedule of each payment (principal + interest) and the total interest paid over the life of the loan.', 'It’s it’s a simple interest loan, the formula for the per di (daily interest) is:\\n\\nAmount borrowed x Interest rate / # of days within that year (365 or 366 for leap year)\\n\\nIf you throw extra $$ at the principal, you’ll beat the bank in terms of the income that they generate in the loan.', \"Most mortgages call for a fixed payment to cover interest and principal (I am ignoring things like PMI and escrow payments).   The equation to figure out the correct monthly payment is a bit complicated, but figuring out what happens each month is simple arithmetic.\\n\\nYou have a loan balance.\\n\\nOne month later you owe interest on that loan balance.\\n\\nYou make your standard payment.\\n\\nInterest is first deducted, then the remainder of the payment is used to reduce the loan balance.\\n\\nRepeat until loan balance is zero.\\n\\n\\nSo at the beginning of your mortgage you have most of the mortgage principal still owed, so a large fraction of your payment t goes to interest.   As you near the end of your mortgage, your principal balance is low and the monthly interest charge is low, so most of your payment goes to paying down the principal.\", \"Most mortgages call for a fixed payment to cover interest and principal (I am ignoring things like PMI and escrow payments).

Soon you change to a better-paying job, and realize this was a bad deal and want to just pay off the remaining balance owed and satisfy the contract.  But in the case of a loan with prepayment penalty, they WON\\'T just accept a payback for the balance owed- they want something for all the interest you WOULD have paid.\\n\\nThis is also sometimes true if you get a better mortgage offer from another bank with a lower interest rate.  You still have a loan, but it\\'s switching lenders.  The new bank pays off the old bank, which could create a prepayment penalty.\\n\\nThese cannot come up as a \"surprise\", they\\'re disclosed as part of the loan terms.  However, when, say, buying a car, the dealer is infamous for pressuring young buyers who do not fully understand all these terms.  As well as layering on unconscionable interest rates.', \"The reason the interest is so large compared to the principal is that the payment schedule is typically based on level amounts.  For instance, if you take a loan out for $100,000 at 2% interest and repay over x years with payments of $3000/yr, interest will comprise the majority of the payment in early years.  Of the first year payment of $3000, $2000 will be interest 2% *100000 and the remaining $1000 will be principal.  In the second year, $1000 of principal has been paid down, so only $99,000 is left on the loan. The interest for year 2 is then 2%*99,000 or $1980.  As a result the interest portion of the 2nd year's $3000 level payment is smaller, so more can go to reducing principal.\", 'Absolutely not. \\n\\nAPR means Annual Percentage Rate. You pay 2% per year, not over the whole life of the loan.', \"Simple interest is based on the amount of days between the date you accept the loan and your next payment. Many lenders will allow you to make payments as often as you would like. Many of my borrowers have elected for a monthly repayment but make weekly payments as they are paid weekly. The more frequent payments, the less interest accrues as interest accrues only on the principal balancing remaining unpaid. The more frequent payments, the less time from one payment to the next. I hope this helps.\", 'The interest is per annum or per year. The interest is figured (compounded) on a regular basis, say monthly. \\n\\nEvery payment you pay the interest on the unpaid balance first and the rest goes to the loan and into escrow to pay your taxes and insurance. \\n\\nLet’s say you payment is $3,000 a month. The first month the interest on 100k would be $2,000 and escrow is $500. That means only $500 goes into reducing your balance and so next month the whole process starts over but this time on a principle of $99,500. \\n\\nThere are a to n of mortgage calculators on the internet. Take special note of what happens when you make extra payments each month.', 'Depends on the loan. A home loan is going to amortize, which means you’ll pay interest and principal every payment cycle til your total loan + interest is 0. So if you take a 100k loan for 10 years, you need to be at $0 owed after 10 years. The interest rate is the cost to borrow the money, represented in a percentage per year. Look up amortization schedules and see how the interest and principal changes.\\n\\nThat said, there are other loans that are interest only, where you only pay the interest. It is similar to what you describe. Borrow $100k, pay $2k/ year in interest. Then at the end of your x period, you gotta poney up the entire amount in cash (also called a balloon payment). Without context for what you’re doing with this loan, it is hard to say what can and cannot be done. Buying your first home? Don’t think you can do an interest only loan anymore. Buying a car? Needs to amortize. Hard money loan? Sure interest only can work. Looking at about 20% down and 10% interest.', 'Look at an Amortization schedule/calculator.', '[deleted]']\n"
